## Progress Logger/Tracker

### Accomplished
* Have run through CONTRIBUTING.md entirely

### Bugs
* Database does not seem to be populated yet - empty

### TODO 
* Go through the notebooks, rest of the README

Store data -> chunk -> for each country we see that countries make promises -> we want to see where exactly these promises are made -> find a creative way to validate the solution is correct -> could possibly do that manually and highlighting a ground truth 

Handle edge cases -> files which don’t work well 

Implement similarity search -> pgvector 
With similarity search extra thing – decide on the threshold 

Evaluation:
Already in the code a way to capture the metadata for the page -> but an extra thing would be to generate this for paragraphs 

This will all be complicated to introduce but can help get top marks
